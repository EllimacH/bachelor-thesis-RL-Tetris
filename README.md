# Bachelor-thesis-RL-Tetris
Reinforcement learning Tetris graduation thesis at USTH
This project explores the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to the game of Tetris. The goal is to develop a DRL agent capable of playing Tetris efficiently by utilizing techniques such as Deep Q-Learning and Double Deep Q-Learning.

## Experiments and Results
The agent was trained for 6000 episodes, achieving an average score of 197137.5. The agent successfully executed various Tetris moves, including T-spins and quad line clears.
